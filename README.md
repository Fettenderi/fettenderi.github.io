# Fettenderi Makes Games

is my portfolio website, where I showcase my most significant projects. The site focuses on Technical Game Design, along with custom Minecraft experience design, highlighting unique mechanics and immersive environments.

Built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) and a modified [Apollo](https://github.com/not-matthias/apollo) theme, the website is crafted to balance both functionality and aesthetics in presenting my work.
