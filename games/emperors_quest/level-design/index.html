I always aim to create an engaging world where players are free to explore and discover the mechanics introduced within thoughout the entire game.<p>The newly acquired item gets introduced first in simple bits. Later down the level a change in the level structure signals also a twist in the level mechanics, with even harder challenges. All those challenges deserve a reward at the end of each level, be it a bunch of collectibles, a great view, a new item or a mix of those.<p>I'm going to do a highlight of the most memorable moments of the game, describing what I was trying to make the player feel and what I was trying to build up to.<h1 id=alternate-path-in-first-cave>Alternate path in first cave</h1><p>In this part of the level I wanted the player to feel free to explore the cave. They can go on the left to interact with a little base they saw before or they can go forwards deeper in the cave.<div class=gallery><img class=gallery-gif src=https://media.giphy.com/media/3BBENHvjEY7hDGveFk/giphy.gif><img class=gallery-gif src=https://media.giphy.com/media/5JFY7ER10o03zwYhK9/giphy.gif></div> If they decide to go to the left they get a glimpse of the next mechanic that will enable destroying leaves. This empowers backtracking and exploration. <h1 id=exploding-bridge>Exploding bridge</h1><p>On this bridge I wanted to convey two things: the true identity of the villain as portrayed on the paintings on the trees and the main mechanic of the level based on the sculk sensors.<p>For those who don't know, these detect vibrations nearby and relay those to sculk shriekers that summon a powerful enemy after some shrieks.<div class=gallery><img class=solo-image src=https://media.giphy.com/media/P35Wpoxr0mJGW45aal/giphy.gif></div><p>So for those who don't know the mechanic this can create curiosity of what could come next and for those who know this makes them scared and more careful.<h1 id=deep-dark-exploration>Deep dark exploration</h1><p>This section of the second level is a calm and at the same time tense exploration place. Even though the only available path is forwards I used ladders and stairs to give the space more verticality.<div class=gallery><img class=solo-image src=https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbGppczB5bjVuMDlrcXI0eW94MXYxNm9mZXdna2I1a21oMXJmNHI0YiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/CdC6U3lWBht1Ieo3TC/giphy-downsized-large.gif></div><p>If you move too fast you will trigger the sculk shriekers that will spawn the warden.<div class=gallery><img class=solo-image src=https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZ2JtZms0N2p3aXJ3MWUyc2I4N2lpd2M2OWR2N2ZhdXZscTdqa2sxdiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/Nj8NDLyAyVASyaSDcC/giphy.gif></div><p>Immediately after that calm sequence there is a frenetic sequence in which the warden will spawn no matter what the player does and it will blast the player with continous attacks until they reach a safe spot.<div class=gallery><img class=solo-image src=https://media.giphy.com/media/XPsph0sIcWBCRPQqPl/giphy.gif></div><h1 id=introduction-of-vertical-magnetic-surfaces>Introduction of vertical magnetic surfaces</h1><p>Working on this level I found out how I could expand the concept of freedom of movement. Verticality is the main idea of this level. These crystals give the player the ability to attach to vertical and horizontal surfaces, glide over large gaps and wander big areas like flying.<div class=gallery><img class=gallery-gif src=https://media.giphy.com/media/TMujwQ3JFlpyTXaVB9/giphy.gif><img class=gallery-gif src=https://media.giphy.com/media/ftqLVM5rXg8MjjDXTb/giphy.gif></div><p>This becomes even clearer at the end of the level where I made a big crystal habit in which all the crystals are formed and where I explain indirectly and directly how they happen to be like this.<div class=gallery><img class=gallery-gif src=https://media.giphy.com/media/T7AZQvWApF3omNXHaV/giphy.gif><img class=gallery-gif src=https://media.giphy.com/media/9VT6IMY6GhR9KsqwUH/giphy.gif></div><h1 id=removal-of-the-golems>Removal of the golems</h1><p>The goal of this section is to prepare the player for a new golem mechanic, the tower and fear mode. To make this mechanic even more powerful I remove all golems from the player, to make them feel powerless.<div class=gallery><img class=solo-image src=https://media.giphy.com/media/VDwTgGyAIkyIDrnI33/giphy.gif></div><p>When the player gets enough golems it will be able to tell them to start to create a tower that can be climbed. With even more golems the enemies will become scared of you and will start to flee.<div class=gallery><img class=gallery-gif src=https://media.giphy.com/media/NvHkPeGlPKqjXgY9c1/giphy.gif><img class=gallery-gif src=https://media.giphy.com/media/vXqVYaROydaCTWRAey/giphy.gif></div></section></article></main></div><footer>made by <a class=white href>fettenderi</a> | 2024 - 2024 Â© <br> built using <a href=https://www.getzola.org>zola</a>, based on <a href=https://github.com/not-matthias/apollo>apollo</a></footer>
