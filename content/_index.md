I’m a 21-year-old Sicilian software engineer studying at the Polytechnic University of Turin. My passion lies in crafting captivating, interactive experiences, especially through game mechanics that resonate with players. I see video games as a powerful art form that has the potential to engage, inspire, and connect.

In my work with Minecraft, I design custom maps and mods focused on unique, immersive experiences. Combining level design with programming, I create tailored items and mechanics to bring each project to life, building worlds that captivate players with every interaction.

Music is another source of inspiration for me; I enjoy exploring diverse genres and languages, and my playlists reflect this eclectic taste, often fueling my creativity.
