_Iâ€™m a 21-year-old Sicilian software engineer studying at the Polytechnic University of Turin. My passion lies in crafting captivating, [immersive experiences](/games/babel-ascent/), especially through [game mechanics](/games/emperors_quest/gameplay-design) that resonate with players. I see video games as a powerful art form that has the potential to engage, inspire, and connect._

<br>
_I have good experience with [Github](https://github.com/Fettenderi), [Godot](https://godotengine.org), [Unity](https://unity.com) and [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com) integration for these engines._
<br>
<br>
_I also have worked on projects in [Minecraft](/games/minecraft) and Java programming, I design custom maps and mods focused on unique, immersive experiences. Combining level design with programming, I create tailored items and mechanics to bring each project to life, building worlds that captivate players with every interaction._
