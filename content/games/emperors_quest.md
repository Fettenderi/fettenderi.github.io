This is a game project, created solely by me in two months, it was commissioned to me by Kendal, I am not sharing it publicly to avoid potential copyright violations from Mojang Studios. That said, I would be glad to share the design details, graphics, and a complete gameplay of the game.

The analysis of the game is divided into 4 core parts:
- [Level Design](/games/emperors_quest/level-design)
- [Gameplay Design](/games/emperors_quest/gameplay-design)
- [System Design](/games/emperors_quest/system-design)
- [Engine Designing Tools](/games/emperors_quest/engine-tools)
