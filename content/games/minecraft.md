# My work for The Chronicles

I began working for The Chronicles during my university years, driven not only by the need to support myself but also by my passion for Minecraft and the scripting involved in its world. My primary role involves creating engaging Minecraft maps and developing mods that elevate the interactive experience of these maps for entertainment purposes. Each project typically starts with a general concept for the video, and from there, I design most of the settings, mechanics, and the overall level flow to bring that vision to life.

Throughout my time working on various projects, a few stand out as ones I’m especially proud of. In this section, I’ll delve into the level design that shaped these projects.
Here's my [Planet Minecraft Page](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/fettenderi/) where you can download all the projects 

# An Explosive Journey

The concept for this video revolved around an escalating display of different TNT types, showcasing their power from the smallest to the most massive explosions. Each TNT was set in a unique environment, chosen either to reflect its origin or to highlight the setting where it’s most commonly used. This approach not only made the explosions more entertaining but also visually emphasized their impact, immersing viewers in the distinctiveness of each blast.

The concept for this map was to showcase an array of creative ways to "eliminate" friends in Minecraft, utilizing as many different mechanics as possible. I set the action within a laboratory where friends act as test dummies, facing a variety of inventive takedowns. The laboratory itself is composed of interconnected rooms linked by doors that defy Euclidean geometry, a subtle twist that adds an extra layer of intrigue with each room transition. Like the first project, this one follows an escalation pattern, using an ideal interest curve to strategically sequence each “elimination” for maximum impact and engagement.

To promote a new book release, I was tasked with creating a map inspired by the book's adventures. The story follows the protagonist on a journey through various eras, each with a unique setting, as they seek to reunite with their doppelgangers from specific periods. Each environment is vividly described in the book, and my role was to bring these settings to life within the game world. The challenges I designed for each era broadly reflect the events of the book, allowing players to experience the key moments of the protagonist’s quest across time in an interactive way.
