Punch Line was the first game I worked on as a Junior Game Programmer, using an engine I wasn't familiar with: Unity. I'd always kept my distance from Unity, despite watching many tutorials and trying the engine a few times, it just never clicked for me. However, after observing an experienced user work with it for a few hours, I was able to contribute to various parts of the project.

My primary responsibility was implementing the SFX and OST using FMOD. Having worked with FMOD before, I was already familiar with its quirks and challenges.

During the whole two days of development I also helped the Game Designer suggesting new mechanics to work on.

If you want to try it, the game is really fun to play. I would recommend playing it with a friend to make the experience more hilarious.
