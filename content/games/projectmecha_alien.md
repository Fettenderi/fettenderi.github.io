After a two-year break from game development, I joined MechJam IV, and for the first time, I wasnâ€™t working alone. I had the opportunity to collaborate with an amazing composer experienced with Wwise and FMOD.

At the start of the project, I was overly ambitious and ended up designing numerous enemies and features. This was the plan I originally had in mind:

<div class = "gallery">
{{ resize_image(path="static/images/projectmecha_alien/image4.png", width=480, height=500, op="fit")}}
{{ resize_image(path="static/images/projectmecha_alien/image5.png", width=480, height=500, op="fit")}}
</div>

By the time we submitted the game, we had zero hours of sleep, only three enemies, three weapons, poor aesthetics, and no polish.

Through this experience, I learned a tough lesson: beware of scope creep, as it can turn a good idea into a complete mess.

Despite the challenges, I really enjoyed working with my teammate [Unconscious Motifs](https://unconscious-motifs.itch.io). He created an incredible dynamic OST for the game, which, along with the buildings I designed as props, were probably the best parts of the project.

<div class = "gallery">
{{ resize_image(path="static/images/projectmecha_alien/image2.png", width=230, height=200, op="fill")}}
{{ resize_image(path="static/images/projectmecha_alien/image3.png", width=230, height=200, op="fill")}}
{{ resize_image(path="static/images/projectmecha_alien/image1.png", width=230, height=200, op="fill")}}
{{ resize_image(path="static/images/projectmecha_alien/image.png", width=230, height=200, op="fill")}}
</div>

The game is rough around the edges, but it's still playable, give it a try.
