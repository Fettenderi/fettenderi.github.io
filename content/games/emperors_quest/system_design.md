# Crowd System:

## First Design:

The hordes system went through many different iterations.

The first concept was inspired by Dream Luigi of Mario & Luigi: Dream Team Bros. and by a Clank minigame of the Ratchet and Clank saga.

It was fairly simple, for each 10 new members a new form would be unlocked, as depicted in this diagram:

</div>

Maybe with more development time I would have made the Giant Chicken Form the way I wanted but in the end I'm happy with what I've achieved.

## Final Design:

The final version of the Controller is based solely on the Leader-Follower Mode. It works through a Singleton, the HiveMind that is being controlled by the HiveController. The HiveMind then relays all its inputs to the available leaders and they do the same with their followers.

<div class = "gallery">
{{ solo_image(path="static/images/emperors_quest/hive_diagram.png", width=1000, height=1000, op="fit") }}
</div>

A HiveMember can change Behaviour at any time with any other Behaviour using common methods.

``` gd, linenos
class_name HiveBehaviour
extends Node2D

var is_active := false
var member : HiveMember

func start(_info := {}): pass

func update_orders(_direction : int, _wants_jump : bool, _wants_tower : bool) -> void: pass

func end(): queue_free()


func become_follower(_info := {}): pass

func become_leader(_info := {}): pass

func become_inactive(_info := {}): pass


func free_member(): pass
```

Probably this isn't the most effective way to do this but it works and solves many problems I had with other iterations of such system.

To describe the modes in which a Member can change Behaviour, I synthesized all possible cases in 4 events described by this diagram. This helped me tackle the code and implementation of such system.

## Case Study: LeaderHiveBehaviour

{{ note(header="Very long code block!", body="The following section is a very long chunk of code, if you couldn't handle the first one don't go forwards. If you are into this, go for it, it's far from perfect but it may be interesting to look at idunno.") }}
