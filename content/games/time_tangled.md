This is my second game, developed over the course of a week. I focused heavily on enhancing its visual appeal and crafting an engaging main game loop to keep players entertained.

I’m proud of how the game turned out, complete with power-ups, a diverse range of enemies, and challenging boss fights. If I were to refine it further, I'd focus on polish, adding more particle effects, enhancing character animations, and incorporating those extra touches that elevate a game from good to great.

One feature I particularly enjoyed designing was the scoring system, which constantly encourages players to push for a higher score. And, for those up to the challenge, there’s a special reward for anyone who can surpass my personal best of 59,610. Give it a try if you're up for it!
