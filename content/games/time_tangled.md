With another year's worth of experience watching tutorials on Youtube and an entire week to work on the project, I was prepared to create a really nice bullet hell.

I really liked how the game turned out, it has power-ups, variety of enemies and bosses. The only thing I would change is polish, I would add way more particles, squash the player and all those really juicy things that make a cool game a really nice one.

Another thing I really like is the scoring system, it gives you a constant incentive to push your high score forward. I also added a little gift if you can beat my personal best of 52000! Why don't you try to beat it ;).
